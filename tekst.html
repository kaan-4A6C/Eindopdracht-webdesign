                don't- you don't even know what it means. It's fine, everythings is fine. theres an infinite number
                of realities Morty, and in a few dozens of those i got lucky and turned everything back to normal.

                That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carp'en all them 'diems. Are these
                pills
                supposed to wake me up or something? Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you; I'm very
                much in charge. Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many
                times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. The flu season dance is about
                awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover. He threatened to turn me in to
                the government, so I made him and the government go away!

                Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down. You don't know me! Like nothing shady ever happened
                in
                a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? You know what those guys do in
                their fancy board rooms? They take their balls and dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each
                other. You know Grandpa goes around and he does his business in public because grandpa isn't shady.
                Not so fast Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty. Just you and me. And
                sometimes your sister, and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You wanna know why, Morty?
                Because he crossed me.
